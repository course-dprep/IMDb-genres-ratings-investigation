Besides the ratings dataset, we also need to obtain data of the genres of the movies to obtain results of the relationship between the two variables. This datset includes many variables that are not all relevant for our research. The variables we are interested in are the variable 'genres' and the variable that includes the id's of the specific movies. Just as the ratings dataset, the id's will be used in the future to merge the datasets. 

```{r}

```

This dataset that includes the genres is also obtained via the provided imdb data.
